## About Me

I'am Shashank
Hello! I'm a final year Computer Science Engineering student at AMC Engineering College, currently immersed in the world of AI/ML as an Annotation Intern at Klatch Technologies. In a dynamic one-month stint at Varcons Technologies, I took on the role of a Full Stack Developer, crafting an ecommerce website using the MERN stack for the restaurant Leisure Square. I also had the privilege of being a Machine Learning and Data Science Intern at Compsoft Technologies, where I spearheaded the development of a Virtual Assistant tailored for the visually impaired. As I navigate my final year, I'm enthusiastic about connecting with professionals who share a passion for technology, AI, and innovative solutions. Let's connect and explore the possibilities that lie at the intersection of creativity and technology!
